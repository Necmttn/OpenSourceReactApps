  "body": "#List for Open Source React , Redux apps.\r\nThis is a collection of open source apps built with React.JS library.\r\n\r\nOpen source projects can be useful both for beginners to learn from reading code and for advanced programmers to save time by using existing code. \r\nThe aim of this collection is to let you pick great projects right away without having to spend hours of searching.\r\nNote that React UI components, boilerplates, tools and frameworks are separated out to make this curation specific to full-working apps built with React.\r\n\r\nFeel  free to Fork Project. \r\n\r\n##Real World Apps  \r\n\r\n- [it's quiz wall](https://github.com/WebbyLab/itsquiz-wall) itsquiz.com  \r\nThere are a lot of tutorials and boilerplates showing how to write isomorphic ReactJs applications. But when it comes to real world apps, you'll find that all the turorials do not cover problems that you face in productions apps.\r\nIn [WebbyLab](https://webbylab.com) , we have a lot of projects written in react and several isomorphic projects. So, it was decides to develop one of these projects on github. So, everyone can see how real-world production isomorphic app can be implmemented.\r\n\r\n- [Sound Redux](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux)  soundredux.io  \r\na simple Soundcloud client\r\n\r\n- [FaveSound](https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux) favesound.de  \r\nThe SoundCloud Client in React + Redux made with passion!\r\nUses redux, redux-thunk, normalizr, react, lodash-fp, airbnb-extended eslint, enzyme and the Soundcloud API.\r\n\r\ncomes with a [comprehensive guide](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/) to get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Clone Apps\r\n\r\n- [https://github.com/echenley/react-news](React-News)  http://henleyedition.com/react-news/  \r\nThis is a real-time Hacker News clone written using React, RefluxJS, and a Firebase backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Experimental Apps\r\n\r\n- [Remember](https://github.com/paulhoughton/remember/) https://paulhoughton.github.io/remember/  \r\nOffline web app to remember locations\r\n\r\n- [Mortgage](http://paulhoughton.github.io/mortgage/) http://paulhoughton.github.io/mortgage/  \r\nMortgage overpayment calculator using React, Redux and D3 4.0\r\n\r\n- [](https://github.com/benoitvallon/react-native-nw-react-calculator) http://benoitvallon.github.io/react-native-nw-react-calculator  \r\nMobile, desktop and website Apps with the same code\r\nThis project shows how the source code can be architectured to run on multiple devices. As of now, it is able to run as:\r\n    * iOS & Android Apps (based on react-native)\r\n    * a Desktop App based on NW or based on Electron\r\n    * a Website App in any browser (based on react)\r\n    **This project uses libraries and tools like:**  \r\n    * es6 syntax and babel\r\n    * react for the Website App and Desktop App,\r\n    * react-native for the iOS & Android Apps\r\n    * NW to package the Desktop App\r\n    * Electron to package the Desktop App\r\n    * flux to organize the data flow management\r\n    * css-loader to integrate the styles in the builds\r\n    * grunt to create the builds\r\n    * webpack to help during the development phase with hot reloading",
